# NSS offload on IPQ5018 with the upstream ethernet stack (branch `ipq50xx-rebase`)

This branch runs the **NSS packet-processing core of the IPQ5018** on kernel
**6.18** with OpenWrt main's **upstream `stmmac` / `dwmac-ipq5018` ethernet
driver** - no `qca-nss-dp`, no `qca-ssdk`. It is the IPQ50xx counterpart of the
[IPQ807x work](README.md) this tree is layered on: same idea (keep the upstream
driver, attach the firmware through a small glue module), different silicon,
different glue.

Validated on the **GL.iNet GL-B3000** (IPQ5018 + QCA8337 + QCN6122):
routed NAT through the firmware at the ceiling of the single 1 GbE CPU port
(~900 Mbit/s measured, ~911 by arithmetic - see *The single CPU port ceiling*) with the CPU
**above 90 % idle** under load. **Wi-Fi runs on the NSS path too** since the
core-clock fix described below: both radios (internal 2.4 GHz + QCN6122),
734/447 Mbit/s through the router over 5 GHz.

> **Branch note.** Work moved to `ipq50xx-rebase` on 2026-09-07, when the
> series was rebased onto Julius's current `nss-edma-rework`. The old

## What is in the branch

Forty-two commits on top of `nss-edma-rework` (base `7e3a860b70`), the ten
below first and the rest of the work on top, in build order:

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `qualcommax: ipq50xx: keep the CMN PLL bus clocks enabled on 6.18` | Without this, 6.18 does not boot on IPQ5018 at all - the SoC dies within milliseconds of the CMN PLL probe. Merged into openwrt/main as [86b584bd0994](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/86b584bd09949f14231d373c46563cc9); still carried here until the base catches up. |
| `qualcommax: stmmac: add a data-plane claim API for the NSS firmware` | Patch `0956`: lets a module take the data path of a GMAC away from stmmac (TX drained, NAPI off, DMA stopped, `ndo_start_xmit` redirected) and hand it back. phylink, MDIO and the netdev stay with the host. |
| `qualcommax: ipq5018: add the NSS core node and reserved memory` | `ipq5018-nss.dtsi`: the `nss0` node with its clocks and interrupts, plus the reserved-memory region for the firmware. |
| `package: add qca-dwmac-nss, the NSS data-plane glue for IPQ5018` | `kmod-qca-dwmac-nss`: the counterpart of `qca-ppe-nss` for this SoC. Implements the `nss-dp` API `qca-nss-drv` expects on top of the stmmac claim. Arms at runtime through debugfs, never at probe. |
| `package: add qca8337-nss, the switch fabric driver for the NSS trunk` | `kmod-qca8337-nss`: re-arms the QCA8337 as a plain 802.1Q fabric after `qca8k` is unbound (see *Why DSA has to go*). |
| `package: nss-tools: add the ipq50xx bring-up service` | `nss-tools-dwmac`: the `nss` service, the ordering that makes the arm work, the one-shot network-config migration. |
| `qualcommax: ipq5018: enable the NSS core on the GL-B3000` | One line in the board DTS: `#include "ipq5018-nss.dtsi"`. |
| `mac80211: ath11k: NSS fixes found while porting wifili to IPQ5018` | Six real bugs met on the way (REO register layout, ring topology, init flags, L2 update frame padding, non-cacheable rings, and one that matters with the offload *off*: a QCN6122 radio no longer disappears because `ath11k_nss_setup()` returns `-ENOTSUPP` for it). |
| `mac80211: ath11k: wifili investigation tooling (inert by default)` | Twenty-two module parameters and traces, all off by default. Kept for whoever repeats the Wi-Fi investigation. |
| `qualcommax: ipq50xx: debug aids for NSS bring-up work` | `MAGIC_SYSRQ_SERIAL`, `DEVMEM` with `STRICT_DEVMEM` off. **Revert this commit for a build meant to be deployed** - it is one commit precisely so that is easy. |

The companion feed is **[kuncy7/nss-packages](https://github.com/kuncy7/nss-packages/tree/ipq50xx-rebase)**,
branch `ipq50xx-rebase`: Julius's feed at `e621a63` plus his twelve `qca-nss-drv`
hardening commits (cherry-picked, authorship preserved) plus five of ours - the
12.2 firmware line as a selectable version, the per-target package split that
lets the stack build on ipq50xx, and four driver patches (`0120`, `0121`,
`0136`, `0137`; see the feed README).

## Quick start

```sh
git clone -b ipq50xx-rebase https://github.com/kuncy7/openwrt-nss-edma.git
cd openwrt-nss-edma

cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf
echo "src-git nss https://github.com/kuncy7/nss-packages.git;ipq50xx-rebase" >> feeds.conf

./scripts/feeds update -a && ./scripts/feeds install -a
./scripts/feeds list -r nss | grep -q qca-nss-drv && echo "nss feed OK"

make menuconfig
make -j$(nproc)
```

**Select `nss-tools-dwmac` in menuconfig, as `<*>` and not `<M>`**
(Network -> nss-tools-dwmac, or `CONFIG_PACKAGE_nss-tools-dwmac=y`). It
pulls in every kmod the plane needs, and it is the package that actually
arms the firmware: without it the glue and the driver load, wait for each
other and nothing happens - `fw_mask` stays `0x0` and the log says
"deferring NSS core probe until a port is armed". `=m` builds the package
but leaves it out of the image, which looks exactly the same. Four people
have been caught by one or the other, so the one check worth doing on a
fresh image is:

```sh
ls /etc/rc.d | grep S19nss     # the arming service is installed
logread -e nss                 # ends with "NSS wired plane + ECM up"
```

Note the service installs as `/etc/init.d/nss`, not `nss-dwmac`.

### Rebuilding on top of an existing build directory

Selecting `nss-tools-dwmac` also switches off the boot-time autoload of
`ath11k`, `ath11k_ahb` and `ath11k_pci`: the `nss` service loads them itself,
after the plane is armed, because `ath11k_base` takes `nss.enabled` from the
module parameter at probe time and never retries. A radio probed before the
core is up stays on the host path for the rest of the boot, or wedges its Q6
outright.

That switch lives in a `make` conditional in `package/kernel/mac80211/ath.mk`,
and **OpenWrt does not rebuild a package because a conditional changed**. On a
tree that has already been built once - including one you only pulled new
commits into - the old package is reused and the change never reaches the
image. Three people have been caught by this. So after changing that symbol,
or after pulling:

```sh
make package/kernel/mac80211/clean
make -j$(nproc)
```

The check on the running board is one line - these files must **not** exist:

```sh
ls /etc/modules.d/ath11k*
```

If they do, the gate is not in your image, and the log will show
`nss state in default init state` / `NSS SOC Initialization Failed :-22`
seconds *before* `nss core 0 booted successfully`.

The `.config` the validated image was built from, reduced to what matters
(everything the packages depend on is pulled in by `nss-tools-dwmac`):

```
CONFIG_TARGET_qualcommax=y
CONFIG_TARGET_qualcommax_ipq50xx=y
CONFIG_TARGET_qualcommax_ipq50xx_DEVICE_glinet_gl-b3000=y

# the runtime; depends on kmod-qca-dwmac-nss, kmod-qca-nss-drv,
# kmod-qca-nss-ecm, kmod-qca-nss-drv-vlan-mgr, kmod-qca8337-nss
CONFIG_PACKAGE_nss-tools-dwmac=y

# firmware: 12.2-156 is the one that works on IPQ5018 (see below)
CONFIG_PACKAGE_nss-firmware=y
CONFIG_NSS_FIRMWARE_VERSION_12_2=y
CONFIG_NSS_MEM_PROFILE_MEDIUM=y

# qca-nss-drv features the plane uses
CONFIG_NSS_DRV_VLAN_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_NSS_DRV_IPV6_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_NSS_DRV_VIRT_IF_ENABLE=y

# PPPoE: the kernel side builds, but ECM only accelerates PPPoE when this
# connection manager is present - without it flows are tracked and never
# offloaded, with nothing in the log to say so.
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-ppp=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-pppoe=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-qca-nss-drv-pppoe=y

# ath11k with the NSS patches applied. Needed for the Wi-Fi offload, and
# the validated combination for the wired plane as well.
CONFIG_PACKAGE_MAC80211_NSS_SUPPORT=y
CONFIG_ATH11K_NSS_SUPPORT=y
CONFIG_NSS_DRV_WIFIOFFLOAD_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_NSS_DRV_WIFI_EXT_VDEV_ENABLE=y
```

Do **not** override the ath11k firmware with files from a stock image. The
package's `WLAN.HK.2.7.0.1` is the one that runs stably here; the stock
`2.9.r4` blob makes the internal 2.4 GHz radio's Q6 assert (`PHY0M3`) about
thirteen minutes after the BSS comes up, on this driver, every time.

### Firmware: why 12.2-156

`NSS_FIRMWARE_VERSION_12_2` selects `NSS.FW.12.2-156-MP.R` from the same
tarball the feed already uses. It is the newest firmware published for IPQ5018
(May 2025, nine months after 12.5) and the only line that works here:

- **12.5-210-MP** ignores the host's TX checksum-generation flags - ICMP works,
  every TCP handshake leaves the wire with a bad checksum - and does not answer
  dynamic-interface (VAP) allocation. The glue's `fw_csum` parameter defaults
  to off because of this; leave it.
- **11.4-6** refuses VAP allocation.

## How the plane comes up

A plain reboot is stock OpenWrt on the host stack. The `nss` service
(`START=19`, before netifd) then does, in this order:

1. **Switch to trunk.** `qca8k` has done the hard bring-up (SerDes, clocks,
   uniphy) at boot; the service unbinds it and loads `qca8337-nss` with the VTU
   map from `nss.general.vtu`. From here the CPU port carries plain 802.1Q.
2. Loads `qca-dwmac-nss` and `qca-nss-drv`. Both are inert at this point:
   `qca-nss-drv`'s probe defers until a port is armed.
3. With `nss.general.wifi_offload=0`, loads ath11k on the host path. With the
   default `1` it leaves ath11k to `nss-dwmac-up`, which loads it after the arm.
4. Starts `/usr/sbin/nss-dwmac-up` alongside netifd. That script waits until
   `eth0` is up, the `lan` interface is up *in netifd's own view*, and the
   bridge has set the promiscuous flag on the trunk; then it arms the firmware
   (`fw_mask` in debugfs), waits for `phys_if 1: started`, loads
   `qca-nss-vlan`, waits for the bridge, loads ECM with `front_end_selection=1`
   and sets `accel_delay_pkts=1`.

Three orderings that fail *silently* - each measured, each cost days - are the
reason for the waiting:

- **arming on a down interface**: the firmware starts, TX works, and not one
  ingress frame is ever delivered;
- **arming while netifd is still applying config**: netifd bounces the
  interface mid-takeover, and the promiscuous flag the bridge sets afterwards
  never reaches the hardware (the RX filter only reaches the GMAC while the
  host still owns it);
- **loading `qca-nss-vlan` before the arm**: the VLAN manager resolves the
  trunk's NSS interface number at `NETDEV_REGISTER` time; before the arm that
  number does not exist, registration fails silently (the driver's debug
  macros are compiled out at the default log level), and every tagged frame
  disappears. Loaded *after* the arm, its notifier replays `NETDEV_REGISTER`
  for the existing `eth0.<vid>` netdevs, so ordering against netifd stops
  mattering.

If the takeover fails, the script exits and the box keeps running on the host
path **with the same topology**. Every failed experiment during this work ended
with a reachable router; that property is worth more than it sounds.

### Topology

Fixed for both data paths: `eth0` is the switch trunk, netifd builds
`eth0.1` (lan) and `eth0.2` (wan) on it. On first boot a uci-defaults script
migrates an existing DSA-style network config once (`br-lan` ports →
`eth0.1`, `wan`/`wan6` device → `eth0.2`) and leaves a marker
(`nss.general.topology='vlan-trunk'`) so it never runs again.

### `uci` knobs (`/etc/config/nss`, section `general`)

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `1` | `0` = stay on the host stack (same topology, no firmware) |
| `wifi_offload` | `1` | load ath11k with `nss_offload=1`, after the arm. Needs ath11k built with NSS support (the service warns if it is not). `0` = Wi-Fi on the host path. |
| `fw_mask` | `0x2` | bitmask of GMACs to hand to the firmware; bit N = GMAC N, and every bit needs a netdev (`trunk` / `extra_ports`). `0x3` arms both; two GMACs have run on the Linksys SPNMX56 and MX6200 and the Xunison D50 (see *Porting*). |
| `vtu` | *(B3000 wiring on the B3000, empty elsewhere)* | VTU program for `qca8337-nss`; empty = VTU off, the switch stays one untagged LAN. Only needed when WAN shares the trunk (see *Porting*) |
| `trunk` | `eth0` | the switch trunk netdev. `eth1` on a board whose GMAC0 has a netdev of its own - a WAN PHY (Xunison D50, Zyxel SCR50AXE) or a second link into the switch (Redmi AX5400, CMCC PZ-L8); `lan` on the MX6200, which has no switch. |
| `trunk_if` | `1` | which GMAC the trunk is = its NSS phys_if. `0` where the switch hangs off GMAC0 (SPNMX56, AX6000) or there is no switch (MX6200). |
| `extra_ports` | *(empty)* | other GMACs in use, as `<if>:<netdev>` entries - the D50's ethernet WAN is `0:wan`, the SPNMX56's 2.5G PHY `1:wan`. Named here, armed by `fw_mask`. |
| `fabric` | `qca8337` | `none` on a board with no switch: skips the qca8k unbind and the fabric module. |
| `switch_dev` | `90000.mdio-1:11` | the switch's MDIO device, unbound from `qca8k` before the re-arm. `90000.mdio-1:18` on the I-O DATA WN-DAX3000GR and the Elecom WRC-X3000GS2 / GST2. |
| `switch_args` | *(empty)* | further `qca8337-nss` parameters, passed verbatim (`cpu_port=`, `ports=`, `wake_phys=`, `bus_via=`) |
| `fw_logbuf` | `256` | firmware log ring size, read at `/sys/kernel/debug/qca-nss-drv/logs` |

There is no runtime detach. `/etc/init.d/nss stop` prints how to disable the
plane across reboots; returning to the host path needs a reboot.

### Checking that it works

```sh
cat /sys/kernel/debug/qca-dwmac-nss/status        # phys_if 1: started dev=eth0 ...
logread -e nss                                    # "NSS wired plane + ECM up (Wi-Fi on the host path)"
cat /sys/kernel/debug/ecm/ecm_nss_ipv4/tcp_accelerated_count   # > 0 under traffic
grep -m1 ipv4_rx_pkts /sys/kernel/debug/qca-nss-drv/stats/ipv4  # climbing under traffic
```

Two things that mislead: the `eth0.1` / `eth0.2` **counters do not see
accelerated traffic** - they show the first packet of each flow and then stop
- and `ipv4_rx_byts` in the firmware stats counts **both directions** of a
flow, so read it as roughly double the useful throughput. `top` is the honest
gauge: idle stays above 90 % under a full-rate flow, softirq stays flat.

## Why DSA has to go

The port model on this SoC is the reverse of ipq807x: the NSS `phys_if` is the
GMAC, and the netdev is the switch trunk. The firmware parses 802.1Q natively
(dynamic interface type 17) but cannot parse the two-byte Atheros header that
DSA's `tag_qca` puts where the ethertype should be; and DSA user ports never
get an NSS interface number, so ECM would not try to accelerate them anyway.
On IPQ5018, **DSA user ports and ECM acceleration are mutually exclusive.**

If you are seeing `eth_rx_unknown_l3_protocol` counting most of your frames,
with `iface_count=0` and `accelerated_count=0`, on a QCA8337 board: this is
why, and no ECM patch will fix it.

What works instead: let `qca8k` do the bring-up, unbind it, and program the
fabric directly - MACs on, Atheros header off, VLANs in the VTU with the front
ports untagged in their VLAN and the CPU port carrying all of them tagged.
`qca8337-nss` does exactly that over raw paged MDIO (the protocol is copied from
`qca8k-8xxx.c`). It is not a probe-based driver: nothing binds automatically,
it reaches the switch through *named* MDIO devices given as parameters.

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `bus_via` | `90000.mdio-1:01` | any MDIO device on the switch's bus, used to find the bus |
| `wake_phys` | `90000.mdio-1:00,…:01,…:02` | front-panel PHYs to power back up (qca8k's teardown leaves them in BMCR power-down) |
| `vlans` | *(empty = off)* | VTU program, `<vid>:<port><t|u>[,…][;…]`; a port listed `u` also gets the vid as PVID |
| `cpu_port` | `0` | the switch port wired to the SoC GMAC (forced 1G full duplex); `255` = none, for boards whose SoC link enters the switch through one of its PHYs and autonegotiates (AX6000, SPNMX56) |
| `ports` | `0x0f` | bitmask of switch ports to enable, CPU port included |
| `switch_fixup` | `1` | the MAC/header/flooding re-arm; `0` = only wake the PHYs |

Load it with `insmod`, not `modprobe`: kmodloader's `modprobe` drops module
parameters. The service does this for you.

## Porting to another IPQ5018 board

The board side is small. The parts, in order of effort:

1. **DTS**: add `#include "ipq5018-nss.dtsi"` to the board file. That is the
   entire diff between the B3000 DTS and a plain board. Boards already in the
   tree (Linksys MX2000 / MR5500 / MX5500, Xiaomi AX6000, …) need only this
   line to get the NSS node and the reserved memory.
2. **Which GMAC feeds what.** phys_if N is GMAC N. On the B3000 the switch is
   on GMAC1 (`fw_mask=0x2`, `trunk=eth0`, `trunk_if=1`) and GMAC0 is unused.
   The glue takes a map of netdevs per phys_if (`ifmap=1:eth0,0:wan`, or the
   same string into `/sys/kernel/debug/qca-dwmac-nss/ifmap`) and arms
   whichever bits `fw_mask` names, so a board with two GMACs in use - the
   switch on one and a WAN PHY on the other - can hand both to the firmware:
   `trunk_if` for the trunk's GMAC, `extra_ports='<if>:<netdev>'` for the
   other, `fw_mask=0x3`. Two GMACs, and a trunk on GMAC0, have run on the
   Linksys SPNMX56 and MX6200 and the Xunison D50.
   Every IPQ5018 board in `02_network` has an entry in the table
   (`nss-dwmac.defaults`, keyed on `board_name`, started by George
   Moussalem). Run on the board: GL-B3000, Linksys MX2000, SPNMX56 and
   MX6200, Xunison D50. Straight from the DTS, untested: Linksys MX5500
   and MR5500 (the MR5500 wiring loads, but its DMA has not started yet),
   Xiaomi AX6000 and Redmi AX5400, Zyxel SCR50AXE, CMCC MR3000D-CI and
   PZ-L8, I-O DATA WN-DAX3000GR, Elecom WRC-X3000GS2 / GST2, Yuncore AX830
   and AX850. On those the settings apply themselves on first boot. Anything
   else logs a line telling you to set them by hand.

3. **The switch.** Find your MDIO device names with
   `ls /sys/bus/mdio_bus/devices/` and set `bus_via` / `wake_phys` from them;
   read the port wiring off the `ethernet-switch` node in your DTS and write
   `cpu_port`, `ports` and the `vlans` map from it. All of it goes into uci -
   `nss.general.vtu` for the VTU map, `nss.general.switch_args` for the rest,
   `nss.general.switch_dev` if the switch is not at `90000.mdio-1:11`.

   Two worked examples straight from the DTS files in this tree (untested on
   the boards themselves - the defaults are the only wiring validated here):

   | Board | CPU port | wan | lan | `switch_args` | `vtu` |
   |---|:---:|---|---|---|---|
   | GL-B3000 (default) | 0 | port 1 / PHY 0 | ports 2-3 / PHY 1-2 | *(none)* | `1:0t,2u,3u;2:0t,1u` |
   | Linksys MX2000 | 6 | port 2 / PHY 1 | ports 3-5 / PHY 2-4 | `cpu_port=6 ports=0x7c wake_phys=90000.mdio-1:01,90000.mdio-1:02,90000.mdio-1:03,90000.mdio-1:04` | `1:6t,3u,4u,5u;2:6t,2u` |
   | Linksys MR5500 | 6 | port 5 / PHY 4 | ports 1-4 / PHY 0-3 | `cpu_port=6 ports=0x7e wake_phys=90000.mdio-1:00,90000.mdio-1:01,90000.mdio-1:02,90000.mdio-1:03,90000.mdio-1:04` | `1:6t,1u,2u,3u,4u;2:6t,5u` |

   A board whose CPU port is not 0 was the one thing the fabric re-arm could
   not do until the `cpu_port` / `ports` parameters; with them the module
   carries no board assumption of its own any more.

Also: a board whose WAN is on the internal GE PHY (GMAC0), like the D50, needs
no VTU at all - the switch only carries LANs, `vlans` can stay empty - and the
migration then puts `br-lan` on the untagged trunk and leaves `wan` alone
(`wan_on_trunk=0` in the table). Whether that WAN gets accelerated is
`fw_mask`: `0x2` keeps it on the host, `0x3` arms it as phys_if 0. Keep it at
`0x3`: on the D50 with `0x2`, ECM created no rule for LAN<->WAN at all and the
CPU sat at 90-100 %, against 4 % with both armed. After changing it, read
`status`: both ports should show `started` with `rs=3 ts=6`.

## What is accelerated

Legend as in the [IPQ807x README](README.md): ✅ offloaded & validated ·
🟨 in code, not validated here · ⬜ not carried · ❌ not available.

| Feature | IPQ5018 | Notes |
|---|:---:|---|
| IPv4 NAT / routing | ✅ | ECM; ~900 Mbit/s at the single-CPU-port ceiling, host >90 % idle |

Not measured here - no PPPoE uplink on this bench. |

### The single CPU port ceiling

Every routed flow crosses the trunk twice - in on one VLAN, out on the other -
and the data of one direction shares the wire with the ACKs of the other. With
1500-byte MTU that is `2×1448 / (2×1542 + 94) ≈ 91 %` of 1 GbE: **~911 Mbit/s**
is the most a single-CPU-port board can route, however idle the CPU is. That
matches the measurements, and it is a property of the board layout, not of the
offload.

### Wi-Fi

Both radios run the firmware's data path, with ath11k on the host doing
management only. It is on by default (`nss.general.wifi_offload=1`, `0` keeps
the radios on the host); the service loads ath11k after the arm, because
`ath11k_nss_setup()` checks the NSS core state at module load and never
retries.

What used to make this impossible was **not** a firmware bug, contrary to what
this file said for weeks. It was `gcc_ubi0_core_clk`: the bootloader leaves the
branch running, Linux has no consumer for it until `qca-nss-drv` probes ~25 s
into boot, so `clk_disable_unused()` gates it at ~2 s and the UBI32 core is
released from reset unclocked. It boots and answers, and the first WPA2 client
then takes the offload down. Kernel patch `0192` flags the branch
`CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED`; measured on cold boots, 11 lives / 0 deaths with the
branch kept against 0 / 3 with it gated. The earlier trap analysis (`0x40004918`,
`PEER_UPDATE_AUTH_FLAG` ordering) was a dead end and is withdrawn.

Two things learned on the way, in case they save someone else the time: results
from warm reboots mean nothing here - one variant lived 5/0 across `reboot` and
died on its first cold boot - and an empty WIFILI section in `nss_stats` was our
own N2H bounds check dropping every SOC statistics message, because those are
larger (2092 B) than the data frame size the host advertises (2048 B).

## Fixes worth knowing about

- **`0136` - park the core before copying the firmware over it.** Warm
  reboots used to leave the NSS core dead one time in two: the old firmware
  was still executing while the new one was copied over it. Holding the core
  in reset around the copy fixed it (4/4 warm reboots). ADCDS's AX3000T port
  documents the same symptom as unresolved; this is the fix.
- **`0137` - map the meminfo block table non-cacheable** (`ioremap_wc`). Found
  first by Adriel Santos for the AX3000T port; carried here with credit.
- **`0192` (kernel) - keep `gcc_ubi0_core_clk` enabled**, so the NSS core never
  leaves reset unclocked. See *Wi-Fi*. Same family as the CMN PLL fix that this
  branch also needs.
- **`0138` (feed) - enable the NSS core clock before setting its rate**, and
  configure it before the AXI buses. Removes the `rcg didn't update its
  configuration` warnings and makes the DTS frequency stick; the core runs at
  1 GHz instead of 850 MHz.

Much of the investigation behind this branch was done with an AI assistant
(Claude) in the loop; every measurement in it was taken on real hardware.
