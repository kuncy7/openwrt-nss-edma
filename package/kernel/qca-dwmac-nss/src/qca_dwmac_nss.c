 * qca_dwmac_nss.c
 *	NSS data-plane glue for the IPQ5018 dwmac ethernet stack.
 *
 * qca-nss-drv is built against the nss-dp API but nss-dp itself was removed
 * from OpenWrt. On IPQ807x, qca-ppe-nss supplies that API on top of the
 * qca_ppe/qca_edma stack. IPQ5018 has neither PPE nor EDMA: it has two
 * Synopsys GMACs driven by dwmac-ipq5018, and the NSS firmware accelerates
 * one by driving its DMA controller directly with firmware-owned rings.
 *
 * The port model is therefore inverted relative to IPQ807x. There, six PPE
 * ports map 1:1 to DSA user ports and the glue overrides each user port,
 * claiming only conduit TX. Here the firmware knows nothing of switch
 * ports: phys_if N is GMAC N itself, so the netdev being overridden is the
 * trunk (on GL-B3000: eth0 = gmac1, the DSA conduit of the QCA8337). DSA
 * stays transparent - tag_qca frames pass through the firmware in both
 * directions (measured at line rate), the conduit remains the stack's
 * transmit device, and user-port demux happens in the DSA receive path
 * exactly as with the host data plane.
 *
 * The takeover sequence differs accordingly: the host DMA must be parked
 * BEFORE the firmware opens the interface (both would drive the same DMA
 * controller), so qca_dwmac_dp_claim() comes first, then mac_addr/mtu/
 * open/link. On IPQ807x the claim is last because EDMA keeps serving the
 * other ports. Unwinding hands the controller back by bouncing the
 * interface, which reinits the host DMA from scratch.
 *
 * Also unlike IPQ807x: phys_if numbering starts at 0 (not 1), there are
 * 2 ports (not 6), and there is no 32-byte TX preheader - although
 * nss-drv's generic dp_ops->init() still adds 32B of needed_headroom,
 * which is tracked and undone like on IPQ807x.
